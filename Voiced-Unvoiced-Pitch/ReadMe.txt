This project objective is to make a separation between voiced and unvoiced sections of an audio file, and estimate pitch for the voiced parts.
The code is written in matlab and includes a GUI. Through the GUI the user may load an audio file or record one himself. 
The separation of voiced and unvoiced sections method is zero crossing rate (ZCR), and the pitch calculation method is autocorrelation.
